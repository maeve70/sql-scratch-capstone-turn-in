Analyzing funnels project I did for Codecademy SQL course. (Using Warby-Parker customer data)
*I realize that the slides are a bit cluttered, but this project had specific items that I had to include. If I had to do over, I'd go with a "less is more" approach to each slide and include an appendix with more explanations about the data and testing.*
